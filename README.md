Here, you will find currently available projects for this year and other useful info.

If you have any questions, spot a bug, or have any suggestions regarding any projects, please create an issue under the [**`issues`**][Issues_Page] tab.

Please test any new developemnts and ideas **in a seperate branch** and submit a [**`pull request`**][Pull_Page] before merging back to the master branch.

## **Rules to live by for commit messages**:
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Donâ€™t end your commit message with a period.

2. Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.

3. Use active voice. For example, "add" instead of "added" and "merge" instead of "merged".

4. Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.
